      <p>In 2015, the GovLab helped government officials in Quito, Ecuador prepare for the imminent eruption of the Cotopaxi Volcano, which was spewing ash for the first time in over a century. The GovLab worked with the municipal government and nonprofit organizations to develop a more nuanced understanding of the public health problems needing to be tackled in connection with the Volcano, and over sixty-five experts joined two months of online discussions.</p>

  <h1>Our Methodology</h1>
</div>

<section class="methodology">
  <div class="row expanded align-center">
    <div class="column large-6 small-12">
      <h5 class="top">Problem Identification and Definition </h5>
      <p>Using our problem definition methodology, we break down a larger issue into actionable, focused problems. Government partners prioritize among problems, selecting the ones to focus on.</p>
      <h5>Curating Guests and Online Conferences</h5>
      <p>We organize an open innovation process that combines self-selection with curation to attract a wide range of diverse experts- specifically those with the experience, not just the credentials. Our team moderates two-hour online conferences focused on a different piece of the problem every week. We brief the most innovative and actionable ideas from the conferences and government partners select from them the ones they want to implement. </p>
      <h5>Putting Ideas into Practice</h5>
      <p class="bottom">Following the conferences, our team conducts research and follow-up interviews to translate ideas into executable implementation plans. We cover those areas governments most need to know to successfully implement a solution, such as cost, timeline, metrics and how-toâ€™s.</p>
